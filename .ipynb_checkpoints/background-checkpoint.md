# Background

This work is largely based on the work of Fenton {cite}`f1999`, [available as a pdf](https://johndfenton.com/Papers/Fenton99Liu-Numerical-methods-for-nonlinear-waves.pdf) from Fenton's [website](https://johndfenton.com). The most relevant section is '3. Period Waves' in the pdf text (p. 6 ff.).

The form of the maximum wave reaches back to Stokes in hand-waving paragraphs in {cite}```Stokes_2009a``` appendix B, and {cite}```Stokes_2009b```. These can be obtained at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/mathematicaland07raylgoog), for those who can't or won't pay for material more than 100 years old. (Some further searching may be needed to get a copy without unreadable pages.) [The most relevant is appendix B, which can be seen here](https://archive.org/details/mathematicaland07raylgoog/page/n240/mode/2up).

Another basic source was Michell {cite}```Michell```, which to be honest I have only scanned. The relevant free version is at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/londonedinburgh5361893lon) or the [actual paper](https://archive.org/details/londonedinburgh5361893lon/page/430/mode/2up) within that.
