# Notes on maximum deep water waves using pseudospectral collocation

I am developing the presentation of my work on deep water waves. In this restart of previous efforts, I begin in the opposite sense to that usually taken of starting from linear small waves and seeing how far the numerical adjustments can reach to achieving the maximum wave, typically up to 98%.

Here, instead I start from the maximum wave and will eventually (but not yet) work my way down to the quasi-linear situation. Also, a further aim is to eventually, with the same caveat, apply a similar approach to finite depth waves.
